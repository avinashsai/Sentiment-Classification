# Text-Classification using different architectures and methods

# Getting Started 
This repository consists of the implementations of various research papers on Text Classification. Implementations will be in Keras,Pytorch and Mxnet.I will be adding Tensorflow with eager execution soon.

# How to run 
Under Each folder i will provide detailed description and necessary packages to install and instructions to run the models

# Description
Folder descripttion:
Datasets - All the datasets
Keras - Implementation in Keras
Pytorch - Implementation in Pytorch
Mxnet - Implementation in Mxnet

# Contributions 

Contributions are always welcome in the form of making code better.
