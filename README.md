# Text-Classification using different architectures and methods

# Getting Started 
This repository consists of the implementations of various research papers on Text Classification. Implementations will be in Keras,Pytorch and Mxnet.I will be adding Tensorflow with eager execution soon.

# Model Implemented

1. Doc2Vec

2. Word2Vec(PreTrained)

3. FastText

# How to run 
Under Each folder i will provide detailed description and necessary packages to install and instructions to run the models

# Description
Folder description:

Datasets - All the datasets

Keras - Implementation in Keras

Pytorch - Implementation in Pytorch

Mxnet - Implementation in Mxnet

# Contributions 

Contributions are always welcome in the form of making code better.
